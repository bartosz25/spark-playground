Hi, 

Welcome to my new repo with *Apache Spark code snippets*. In my other repository [spark-scala-playground](https://github.com/bartosz25/spark-scala-playground) I'm demonstrating Apache Spark with the idea of _learning tests_. Although I like this approach, it can't be used to demonstrate everything. That's why you will find here more demo-like projects used in the blog posts on [waitingforcode.com](https://www.waitingforcode.com). 

The code is free of charge but if you want to say thank you, you can [offer me a Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/waitingforcode) ❤️

Best,
Bartosz.
