Hi, 

Welcome to my second repo with **Apache Spark code snippets**. 

In my first repository [spark-scala-playground](https://github.com/bartosz25/spark-scala-playground) I'm demonstrating Apache Spark features with the help of _learning tests_. Although I like this approach, it can't be used to show everything. That's why in this repository you will find the code based on a different approach. Instead of learning tests, you will find small projects demonstrating one Apache Spark feature. I used most of them to record demo videos for [waitingforcode.com blog posts](https://www.waitingforcode.com). 

The code is free of charge but if you liked it and want to say thank you, you can [offer me a Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/waitingforcode) ❤️

Best,
Bartosz.
